## Usage

After installing and activating the WSB Event Manager plugin, you can manage and display events in the following ways:

### Creating an Event

1. In the WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to the **Events** section on the sidebar.
2. Click **Add New** to create a new event.
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Event Title**: The name of your event.
   - **Event Description**: A detailed description of your event.
   - **Event Date**: The date and time of your event.
   - **Event Location**: The location or venue where the event will take place.
4. Once the event details are filled in, click **Publish** to make the event live.

### Displaying Events

To display a list of upcoming events on the front end of your site, use the `[event_list]` shortcode in a post or page. The shortcode will automatically display events sorted by date, with the most recent event at the top.

#### Shortcode Example

[event_list]
This will display a list of all upcoming events with the default settings.

[event_menu]
This will display upcoming events as menu items without details (names only).

### Shortcode Attributes

You can modify the behavior of both event shortcodes by using the following attributes:

    - **show_title:** This attribute controls whether or not the heading "Upcoming Events" is displayed above the list.

        - **Options:** true (default), false
        - **Example:** [event_list show_title="false"]

    - **sorting:** This attribute controls the order in which events are displayed, based on the event date.

        - **Options:** true (default), false
        - **Example:** [event_menu sorting="desc"]

    Combined Example:
    To display a list of events without the title and in descending order, use:
    [event_list show_title="false" sorting="desc"]

### Event Archives

The plugin also creates an archive for events. You can customize the slug for event archives via the rewrite parameter in the plugin code.

#### Adding Event Archive to Menu

To add an event archive to the siteâ€™s navigation menu:

    - Go to Appearance > Menus in the WordPress admin dashboard.
    - Select the Events custom post type archive from the available items and add it to your desired menu.
    - Save the menu.
    
This will create a direct link to the archive page where users can browse all published events.

## Frequently Asked Questions

After activation, go to "Events" in the WordPress admin sidebar, click "Add New," and fill out the required event details.
